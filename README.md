# Link Checker


This is a first year project I made after one of my family members was a victim of phishing.
It is a simple website setup with a backend written in python and a frontend written in javascript.

The backend is using requests on VirusTotal API and IPQualityScore API for checking if the link that is sent from the frontend are malicious or not. The backend is using flask for it's server so it will have a development server. The APIs keys are not hardcoded, they are in an .env file.

The frontend is stylied using html and css. After that it is sending a POST request to the backend with the url(as a string) it got as input
## Features

- **URL Safety Check:**  
  Queries the VirusTotal API and IPQualityScore API to analyze URLs.
- **Real-Time Results:**  
  Displays whether a URL is safe or malicious along with detailed analysis from both APIs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Clean, neon-themed design with interactive feedback.
- **Flask Backend:**  
  A minimalistic server that handles POST requests to check URL safety.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:**  
  Ensure Python is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Flask & Other Dependencies:**  
  See [Requirements.txt](Requirements.txt) for a full list of Python packages.
- **Internet Connection:**  
  Required to query external APIs for URL analysis.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/link-checker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd link-checker
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r Requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure API Keys:**

   Create a file named `keys.env` in the project root and add your API keys:

   ```env
   VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key_here
   IPQUALITYSCORE_API_KEY=your_ipqualityscore_api_key_here
   ```

6. **Run the Flask Server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Open the Frontend:**

   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser, or serve it via a static server.

2. **Usage:**

   - Enter the URL you want to check into the input field.
   - Click the **Check URL** button.
   - The page will display the analysis results, indicating if the URL is malicious along with detailed results from the APIs.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:**  
  Contains the HTML structure and user interface for the Link Checker.

- **style.css:**  
  Provides the styling for the application, including a neon, glitch-like aesthetic.

- **script.js:**  
  Handles user interactions, sends the URL to the backend, and updates the DOM with the results.

- **app.py:**  
  The Flask backend server that processes URL checks using the VirusTotal and IPQualityScore APIs.

- **Requirements.txt:**  
  Lists all required Python packages (Flask, requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, gunicorn, python-dotenv).

- **keys.env:**  
  Contains API keys. This file is ignored in version control by `.gitignore`.

- **.gitignore:**  
  Specifies files and directories (like `keys.env` and Python caches) to be ignored by Git.

## Usage Example

1. **Start the Backend:**  
   Run `python app.py` to launch the Flask server.

2. **Open the Frontend:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. **Check a URL:**  
   Enter a URL into the input field and click **Check URL**. The result box will update with the URL analysis.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
  Better feedback for network issues or invalid URLs.
- **User Authentication:**  
  Restrict access to prevent abuse of the service.
- **Additional API Integrations:**  
  Incorporate more security checks for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Improved UI/UX:**  
  Refine the interface with more animations and responsive design.
